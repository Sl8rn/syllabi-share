# SyllabiShare

SyllabiShare is a web application created at the University of Virginia after seeing that a lot of our students wanted to see a class's syllabus and policies before signing up for it, and there was no streamlined way to do this. Our app allows students to share the syllabi of their classes with all the other students using the app at their school. This makes the process of choosing which classes to take easier, all while giving the students the peace of mind that they will be able to have a head start on the classes they chose.

## Getting Started

These instructions will detail how to use SyllabiShare.

### URL: http://syllabi-share.herokuapp.com/

### Logging In and Logging Out

We use Google OAuth to handle logging into our application, so as long as you have a university-related .edu Google Account you can use it. Simply click the button that says "Please Login with a .edu Email" and it will take you to the Google login screen. To logout click your email address at the top right corner. It opens a dropdown menu then click the "Logout" button to logout. Login is to help identify which school you come from so that we can direct you to the correct syllabi. 

### Finding a Syllabus

SyllabiShare sorts syllabus by department so to find a Syllabus click on the department that corresponds to the department of the syllabus you are looking for then scroll down until you see the syllabus you are looking for.    SyllabiShare is reliant on students uploading Syllabi due to this it is possible that you do not find a syllabus that you are looking due to it not being uploaded yet.
